Analysis:

1. This data analysis shows the grade averages of schools in the district by type, size, student grade, and spending per student. 

2. It seeks to display the discrepancies so that we can see what contributes to better student outcomes. 

3. If I were to design this project, I would want to see charts and the like to display the data so that we can present it to the "district". 

4. The average large school is doing worse in both reading and arithmatic than the small or medium schools. This diverges from funding. 

5. Large schools are receiving more per capita than small ones. 

6. Charter schools have much better outcomes, per the scoring, but it's important to note that we don't know why. 

7. The largest charter school is smaller than the largest district school, but the largest charter school spends approximately the same amount as the large district schools, so it is possible that charter schools are "more costly but have superior outcomes", but because there is such a size disparity we haven't yet identified that discrepancy.
